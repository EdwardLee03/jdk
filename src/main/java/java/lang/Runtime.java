     * Registers a new virtual-machine shutdown hook.
     *
     * <p> The Java virtual machine <i>shuts down/停止运作</i> in response to two kinds
     * of events:
     *
     *   <ul>
     *
     *   <p> <li> The program <i>exits</i> normally, when the last non-daemon
     *   thread exits or when the <tt>{@link #exit exit}</tt> (equivalently,
     *   <tt>{@link System#exit(int) System.exit}</tt>) method is invoked, or
     *   当最后非守护线程退出或 {@link #exit(int)}/{@link System#exit(int)} 被调用时，
     *   程序正常退出。
     *
     *   <p> <li> The virtual machine is <i>terminated</i> in response to a
     *   user interrupt, such as typing <tt>^C</tt>, or a system-wide event,
     *   such as user logoff or system shutdown.
     *   虚拟机被终止来响应用户中断或系统范围的事件。
     *
     *   </ul>
     *
     * <p> A <i>shutdown hook</i> is simply an initialized but unstarted
     * thread.  When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will
     * start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order and let
     * them run concurrently.  When all the hooks have finished it will then
     * run all uninvoked finalizers if finalization-on-exit has been enabled.
     * Finally, the virtual machine will halt.  Note that daemon threads will
     * continue to run during the shutdown sequence, as will non-daemon threads
     * if shutdown was initiated by invoking the <tt>{@link #exit exit}</tt>
     * method.
     * <p>
     * 关闭挂钩是一个已初始化但未开始运行的线程。
     *
     * <p> Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by
     * invoking the <tt>{@link #halt halt}</tt> method, which forcibly
     * terminates the virtual machine.
     * <p>
     * 一旦关闭序列已经开始运行，只能通过调用 {@link #halt(int)} 才停下来。
     *
     * <p> Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a
     * new shutdown hook or de-register a previously-registered hook.
     * Attempting either of these operations will cause an
     * <tt>{@link IllegalStateException}</tt> to be thrown.
     *
     * <p> Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual
     * machine and should therefore be coded defensively.  They should, in
     * particular, be written to be thread-safe and to avoid deadlocks insofar
     * as possible.  They should also not rely blindly upon services that may
     * have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in
     * the process of shutting down.  Attempts to use other thread-based
     * services such as the AWT event-dispatch thread, for example, may lead to
     * deadlocks.
     * <p>
     * 关闭挂钩运行在虚拟机的生命周期里的一个微妙时间，所以应该是防御式地编码。
     *
     * <p> Shutdown hooks should also finish their work quickly.  When a
     * program invokes <tt>{@link #exit exit}</tt> the expectation is
     * that the virtual machine will promptly shut down and exit.  When the
     * virtual machine is terminated due to user logoff or system shutdown the
     * underlying operating system may only allow a fixed amount of time in
     * which to shut down and exit.  It is therefore inadvisable to attempt any
     * user interaction or to perform a long-running computation in a shutdown
     * hook.
     * <p>
     * 关闭挂钩应能迅速地完成其工作。
     *
     * <p> Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any
     * other thread, by invoking the <tt>{@link ThreadGroup#uncaughtException
     * uncaughtException}</tt> method of the thread's <tt>{@link
     * ThreadGroup}</tt> object.  The default implementation of this method
     * prints the exception's stack trace to <tt>{@link System#err}</tt> and
     * terminates the thread; it does not cause the virtual machine to exit or
     * halt.
     * <p>
     * 未捕获异常是在关闭挂钩中被处理，通过调用线程的 {@link ThreadGroup#uncaughtException(Thread, Throwable)}。
     *
     * <p> In rare circumstances the virtual machine may <i>abort</i>, that is,
     * stop running without shutting down cleanly.  This occurs when the
     * virtual machine is terminated externally, for example with the
     * <tt>SIGKILL</tt> signal on Unix or the <tt>TerminateProcess</tt> call on
     * Microsoft Windows.  The virtual machine may also abort if a native
     * method goes awry by, for example, corrupting internal data structures or
     * attempting to access nonexistent memory.  If the virtual machine aborts
     * then no guarantee can be made about whether or not any shutdown hooks
     * will be run.
     * <p>
     * 在极端情况下，虚拟机可能被中止，即停止运行没有正常终止。

    /**
     * Executes the specified command and arguments in a separate process with
     * the specified environment and working directory.
     *
     * <p>Given an array of strings <code>cmdarray</code>, representing the
     * tokens of a command line, and an array of strings <code>envp</code>,
     * representing "environment" variable settings, this method creates
     * a new process in which to execute the specified command.
     *
     * <p>This method checks that <code>cmdarray</code> is a valid operating
     * system command.  Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
     * but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
     * non-null strings.
     *
     * <p>If <tt>envp</tt> is <tt>null</tt>, the subprocess inherits the
     * environment settings of the current process.
     *
     * <p>A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
     * be required to start a process on some operating systems.
     * As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
     * settings beyond those in the specified environment.
     *
     * <p>{@link ProcessBuilder#start()} is now the preferred way to
     * start a process with a modified environment.
     *
     * <p>The working directory of the new subprocess is specified by <tt>dir</tt>.
     * If <tt>dir</tt> is <tt>null</tt>, the subprocess inherits the
     * current working directory of the current process.
     *
     * <p>If a security manager exists, its
     * {@link SecurityManager#checkExec checkExec}
     * method is invoked with the first component of the array
     * <code>cmdarray</code> as its argument. This may result in a
     * {@link SecurityException} being thrown.
     *
     * <p>Starting an operating system process is highly system-dependent.
     * Among the many things that can go wrong are:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The operating system program file was not found.
     * <li>Access to the program file was denied.
     * <li>The working directory does not exist.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>In such cases an exception will be thrown.  The exact nature
     * of the exception is system-dependent, but it will always be a
     * subclass of {@link IOException}.
